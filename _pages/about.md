I am a Ph.D. student in [Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE)](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, advised by [Prof. Jianliang Qian](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/qian/). Prior to MSU, I obtained my M.Phil. and B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Shingyu Leung](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~masyleung/).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on computational and applied mathematics, with particular interests in:

- **Numerical methods for differential equations on manifolds** 
- **Visualization methods for dynamical systems** 
- **Optimal control, mean-field games, and related inverse problems**

## Honors & Awards

- **Croucher Scholarship** (2025–2028), Croucher Foundation
- **Honourable Mention, Best TA Award** (2023–2024), HKUST
